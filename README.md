Write a program that will output circled numbers arranged in squares of size increasing according to the fibonacci sequence:

1x1, 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, 5x5, 8x8, 13x13, etc.

The circles in the first area should be black, in the second purple, in the third green, blue, red, orange, then black again, purple, etc.

The data that can be in the circles could either be:
- a list of numbers, from 1 to N
- a list of dates in the format DD/MM
